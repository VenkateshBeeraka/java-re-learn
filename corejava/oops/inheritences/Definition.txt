Inheritance in Java is a core OOP concept that allows a class to acquire properties and behaviors from another class. 
It helps in creating a new class from an existing class, promoting code reusability and better organization.
A subclass can reuse the fields and methods of the parent class without rewriting the code
A subclass can add its own fields and methods or modify existing ones to extend functionality.

Types:
1. Single Inheritance:
Parent
  ↓
Child

2. Multilevel Inheritance:
GrandParent
    ↓
  Parent
    ↓
  Child

3. Hierarchical Inheritance
      Parent
    /   |   \
Child1 Child2 Child3

4. Multiple Inheritance (NOT Supported for Classes)
Parent1   Parent2
    \      /
     Child

5. Hybrid Inheritance (NOT Supported for Classes)
      A
     / \
    B   C
     \ /
      D

Advantages of Inheritance:
Code Reusability - Reuse existing code without rewriting
Method Overriding - Runtime polymorphism
Extensibility - Easy to add new features
Data Hiding - Using protected access modifier
Reduces Code Redundancy - Common code in parent class

Disadvantages of Inheritance:
Tight Coupling - Parent and child are tightly coupled
Increased Complexity - Deep inheritance hierarchies hard to maintain
Fragile Base Class Problem - Changes in parent affect all children
Not Always Natural - Sometimes composition is better
