Composition is an object-oriented design technique where a class is composed of one or more objects of other classes, 
creating a HAS-A relationship. Unlike inheritance (IS-A), composition promotes loose coupling, flexibility, 
and follows the principle of 'favor composition over inheritance.' 
The lifetime of the contained object is managed by the container object.

When to Use Composition vs Inheritance:-

Use Inheritance When:
True IS-A relationship exists
You want to use polymorphism
Base class won't change frequently
Example: Dog IS-A Animal

Use Composition When:
HAS-A or PART-OF relationship exists
You need flexibility to change behavior
You want loose coupling
You need multiple behaviors from different classes
Example: Car HAS-A Engine
